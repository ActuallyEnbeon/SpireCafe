## Contribution
Either modargo, Mindbomber or I (erasels) will be reviewing your pull request and suggest changes to code and/or design and balance if needed to keep the project cohesive. Since the start of this project is during the christmas holidays, we may be slow to respond but don't worry, we will.
  
### Technical Guidelines



#### Cards, relics, powers, etc.
Cards, relics, powers, patches, and everything else should go in the package you created for your attraction.

There are abstract classes that you should extend in the abstracts package: `AbstractSCCard`, `AbstractSCRelic`, and `AbstractSCPower`.
